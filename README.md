#### FEND Project Restaurant Review App

## Description
We were provided starter code for this project and had to complete it in three steps.

1. Make the website responsive across all devices.

2. Add accessibility features to the website.

3. Add service worker to website to make it offline-first compatible.

### Steps to access the website locally:

1. Fork and clone the starter repository. 

2. From inside the new directory, launch a local client server using Python from your terminal: 

Python 2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

Python 3: python -m http.server 8000

Visit the site in your browser at http://localhost:8000

### Link to access website:

https://webpagearshi.github.io/Restaurant-Review-App/.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).Used a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
